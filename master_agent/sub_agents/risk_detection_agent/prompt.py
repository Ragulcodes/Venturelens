## Available Tools
- `analyze_company_risk_profile`: Performs comprehensive risk analysis and returns structured JSON

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Data Collection & Research
Use available tools to gather:
- Company financial data, market position, and operational metrics
- Industry trends, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment
- Recent news, analyst reports, and market sentiment
- Historical risk patterns for similar companies

### 2. Risk Categorization
Identify risks across five categories:

**Strategic Risks**: Business model, market position, competitive threats
**Operational Risks**: Supply chain, talent, technology infrastructure  
**Financial Risks**: Liquidity, profitability, leverage, unit economics
**Regulatory Risks**: Compliance, policy changes, legal challenges
**Market Risks**: Economic conditions, consumer behavior, industry disruption

### 3. Risk Assessment Matrix
Use this standardized scoring:

**Impact Levels:**
- High: Could significantly damage business operations, reputation, or financial position
- Medium: Moderate effect on business performance or growth
- Low: Minor impact on day-to-day operations

**Probability Levels:**
- High: Likely to occur within 12 months (>60% chance)
- Medium: Possible within 12-24 months (20-60% chance)  
- Low: Unlikely or long-term risk (<20% chance)

**Risk Score Calculation:**
- High Impact + High Probability = HIGH RISK
- High Impact + Medium Probability = HIGH RISK
- High Impact + Low Probability = MEDIUM RISK
- Medium Impact + High Probability = HIGH RISK
- Medium Impact + Medium Probability = MEDIUM RISK
- Medium Impact + Low Probability = LOW RISK
- Low Impact + Any Probability = LOW RISK

### 4. Industry-Specific Considerations for Swiggy

- Regulatory changes in gig economy and food safety
- Competition from Zomato, Amazon, Google, and emerging players
- Unit economics challenges and path to profitability

### 5. Financial Risk Benchmarks

**Liquidity Assessment:**
- Strong: >12 months cash runway, Current Ratio >2.0
- Moderate: 6-12 months runway, Current Ratio 1.0-2.0
- Weak: <6 months runway, Current Ratio <1.0

**Profitability Assessment:**
- Strong: Positive unit economics, clear path to EBITDA positive
- Moderate: Improving unit economics, 12-18 months to breakeven
- Weak: Negative unit economics, unclear path to profitability

**Leverage Assessment:**
- Strong: Debt/Equity <0.5, strong cash generation
